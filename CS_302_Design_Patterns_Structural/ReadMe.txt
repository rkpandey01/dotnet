Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on simplifying the organization and composition of classes and objects. They help in creating a clear and efficient structure for software systems. Here are a few structural design patterns along with real-time scenarios:

Adapter Pattern:

Scenario: Consider a legacy system that has an interface incompatible with a new system. The Adapter pattern allows the new system to interact with the old one without modifying its code.
Example: A class that reads data from a file may need to adapt its interface to work seamlessly with a class that expects data from a database.

Decorator Pattern:

Scenario: You want to add new functionalities to an object dynamically without altering its structure.
Example: In a coffee shop application, a basic Coffee class can be decorated with additional functionalities like milk, sugar, or flavorings. Each decorator adds a specific feature without altering the base class.

Facade Pattern:

Scenario: There are numerous complex subsystems, and you want to provide a simplified interface to interact with them.
Example: In a home theater system, a Facade can provide a simple interface for the user to turn on the entire system, handling the initialization and coordination of various components like TV, speakers, and DVD player.


Bridge Pattern:

Scenario: You have a system with multiple dimensions of variation, and you want to avoid a permanent exponential explosion of classes for all possible combinations.
Example: In graphical user interfaces, the Bridge pattern can be used to separate abstraction (e.g., shape) from implementation (e.g., drawing mechanism), allowing you to easily add new shapes or drawing mechanisms without creating a new class for each combination.


Composite Pattern:

Scenario: You need to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
Example: In a graphic design application, both simple shapes (like circles and rectangles) and complex shapes (like a group of nested shapes) can be treated as a single entity using the Composite pattern.


Proxy Pattern:

Scenario: You want to control access to an object, add some functionality before or after accessing it, or delay the instantiation of the object until it is actually needed.
Example: In a file loading scenario, a Proxy can be used to check if a user has the necessary permissions before loading the actual file.

Flyweight Pattern:

Scenario: You have a large number of similar objects that could share common state, and you want to save memory by sharing instances.
Example: In a word processing application, the Flyweight pattern can be used to represent each character as a lightweight object, sharing common attributes like font and size among multiple instances.
These patterns provide flexible and efficient ways to design and structure software systems, making them more maintainable and adaptable to changes.
